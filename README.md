Hey! My name's Boris and welcome to my GitHub. This is where i display all of my public projects, code snippets, exercise, etc. A virtual playground of my own so to speak. Finishing a coding course over the past couple of months and entering the world of Web Design opened my eyes to the endless possibilities programming has to offer and i am especially excited to share them with anyone willing to give me a few minutes time! 

If you are a hiring professional i am currently actively looking for a spot as a junior fullstack developer and would be happy to gain experience in any capacity.

If you're just stopping by and looking through my page for fun say hi and maybe we can work on some code together!

Other than that, as my programming trainer says, best of luck and happy coding everyone!
